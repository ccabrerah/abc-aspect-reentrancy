# This file is parsed to produce changelog information in a variety
# of formats. Start new entries with a '$', and continuation lines 
# with a ';'. Normally lines denoting a new release are added automatically,
# but the format is "%<version number> <unixtime>" if you need 
# to make one of your own. Lines beginning with '#' are ignored, predictably
# enough. 
#
# You should wrap your lines at 76 characters, so that things which indent
# it further do not run over 80 characters.
#
# Information for "extenders", such as a warning of an interface change, 
# or an addition of a new interface, should be started with a '!' instead 
# of a '$'.
# 
# You should generally avoid changing the file below a line starting
# with '%', as this would alter the changelog for versions that are already
# released.
#
# If you mess around with the packaging for a specific distribution,
# add a line saying "^debian:" before the changelog entry (currently only
# debian and redhat are understood here, and we don't actually have a 
# redhat package).
# 
# If you want to change the name that is recorded as making a release,
# add a line in the form "&name of releaser <email@address>".
#
# The scripts that process this file are:
# dist/makechangelogs.pl - to generate various formats for it

%1.3.0 1207124346
!The structure of the AbcExtension class has been reworked; in particular,
;the entire compilation process is now driven by a CompileSequence. This
;allows greater flexibility in replacing parts of the compiler; in
;particular, it is possible to replace the complete frontend or backend.
$abc now has a completely re-written frontend. It is no longer pure-Java,
;but is a modern form of attribute grammar - compiled with the JastAdd
;meta-compiler. The new frontend extends the existing Java
;and Java 5 frontends written by the creator of JastAdd, Torbjorn Ekman.
;As a result, abc now supports Java 5 source code! (but not AspectJ 5)
;To use the new frontend, invoke abc with the option: -ext abc.ja
!abc extenders wishing to write their extensions using JastAdd should
;extend abc.ja.AbcExtension, abc.ja.CompileSequence, etc. rather than
;abc.AbcExtension as they normally would - see the new implementation
;of EAJ-ja for an example of how this is done.
$abc.eaj now supports the arrayget()/arrayset() pointcut primitives.
$abc now supports multiple whole-program optimizations for tracematches.
;Those can be enabled by selecting the extension abc.tmwpopt instead of
;abc.tm. The optimization level can be set using the command line option
;-laststage. (see -help)
$abc.eaj now supports additional pointcuts, in particular the
;arrayget/arrayset pointcuts and the lock/unlock pointcuts (enabled via
;-debug enableLockPointcuts)
;see: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=123759
$abc further supports the new pointcut maybeShared() that matches
;field set and get events affecting fields which are potentially
;shared between threads. In the default setting, this pointcut matches
;*all* sets/gets; to enable whole-program optimizations, state
;-debug optimizeMaybeSharedPointcut on the command line.

%1.2.1 1154710255
$abc now supports mutiple reweaving analyses. Those analyses are
;executed on the woven program and may change e.g. the residues
;in order to produce a different (e.g. more efficient) woven
;program. See abc.main.AbcExtension.createReweavingPasses(List) for an
;example integration of our CFlow optimization.
;Custom analyses need to implement the
;abc.weaving.weaver.ReweavingAnalysis interface.
;They are scheduled via instances of ReweavingPass.
;Passes can also be annotated with a timeout so that abc stops them
;automatically when exceeding this timeframe.
$There have been a number of fixes to the 'indexing' optimisation
;for tracematches. In particular, it should now behave correctly even
;for tracematches that include "non-collectable weak reference 
;indices". Depending on the base program, there may also be
;performance improvements (we have observed up to 10%).
!abc has been upgraded to use a newer version of the Polyglot compiler
;framework. We now use Polyglot 1.3.2, which should significantly
;improve compilation of pure-java programs.

%1.2.0 1145636677
$The 'indexing' optimisation for tracematches now doesn't introduce a
;further dependency by default, but uses classes provided in the abc
;runtime. The old behaviour can be restored by passing abc the flag
;'-debug useCommonsCollections'; doing this will of course require a
;Commons Collections jar on the classpath. Our preliminary experiments
;suggest that our implementation is slightly slower than the Commons
;Collections on 1.4 JVMs, but slightly faster on 1.5 JVMs.

%1.1.1 1142785477
$Implemented various tracematch optimisations, as described in tech
;report abc-2006-1, available from our website 
;(http://aspectbench.org). Some of them can be disabled via debug
;flags, which is how we took some of the numbers given in the tech
;report. Of interest is '-nodebug useIndexing', which disables the
;indexing data structures and algorithms, and '-debug
;onlyStrongRefs', which disables our leak analyses.
$Currently, if you use tracematches with indexing, there will be
;an extra compile-time and run-time dependency on the Apache
;Commons Collections library. This is because the indexing data
;structures make internal use of it. We plan to implement the
;data structures fully in abc and so avoid this dependency for
;our 1.2.0 release.
$Added two new pointcuts to the EAJ (Extended AspectJ) extension.
;The first, let(var, expr) binds the variable var to the result of
;the expression expr. The second takes the form 'contains(pc())'.
;It matches shadows which contain shadows matching pc().
$Changes to open module precedence. First, the order induced 
;by friend and module inclusion is now consistent with 
;declare precedence (i.e. first declared is executed first).
;Second, added a constraint that preserves the precedence
;coherence of friend aspects in a module (i.e. an external aspect 
;may no longer be inserted between two internal aspects 
;using declare precedence).
$Various bugfixes; see Bugzilla for details.
!You can now customise inlining behaviour by overriding the
;makeAdviceInliner method in abcExtension. An example can be
;found in the EAJ extension.

%1.1.0 1129329464
$Implemented trace match extension. Run this with 'java abc.main.Main
;-ext abc.tm'. Trace matches are a mechanism for running advice when
;certain properties hold in the execution trace. The design and
;implementation is presented in our OOPSLA 2005 paper, available from
;our website.
$Implemented open modules extension. Run this with 'java abc.main.Main
;-ext abc.om'. Our implementation is an extension of Jonathan Aldrich's
;work to AspectJ, but includes various novel ideas. It is described in
;detail in tech report abc-2005-2, available from our website.
$Included the interprocedural analyses described in our PLDI'05 paper
;in the main abc release. They can be run by specifying the option -O3.
;Note that if you give this option, you will also have to provide the
;-main-class <Class> option as a starting point for the control flow
;analysis.
$The implementation of advice precedence (which was subtly broken in previous 
;releases) has been fixed. In MethodAdviceList, advice lists are now 
;topologically sorted according to precedence. The implementation detects 
;when there is nondeterminacy in the ordering. Many non-trivial AspectJ 
;programs are ambiguous in this way, so by default the ambiguities are 
;not reported. To turn them on, use the flag "-debug warnPrecAmbiguity=true". 
;We may promote this to a proper flag in future releases, as it is
;often useful in debugging AspectJ code.
!If your extension changes the precedence order, or introduces a new
;kind of advice (other than before/after/around), you should override
;the getPrecedence method in abcExtension. An example can be found in
;the tracematch extension abc.tm.
!If you wish to restrict the matching process by adding conjuncts to
;existing residue generation, override residueConjuncts in AbcExtension.
;This provides a way for implementing various aspect interface features
;via AspectJ. An example can be found in the open modules extension abc.om.
!The signature of Pointcut.matchesAt has changed to take a MatchingContext
;that wraps up its previous set of parameters (WeavingEnv, SootClass,
;SootMethod,ShadowMatch). This makes it possible to write extensions 
;where matching depends on a richer context than the standard AspectJ
;one. An example can be found in the open modules extension abc.om.

%1.0.2 1109287327
$Updated runtime library for a more efficient implementation of cflow. 
;The -abc101runtime option causes abc to generate code for the previous
;implementation of cflow for compatibility.
$Fixed a bug in EAJ with using private pointcut variables together with
;calls to named pointcuts.
!Added some javadoc to the abc.weaving.aspectinfo.Pointcut class,
;to make it clearer what deriving classes need to do.
$Fixed bugs 44 and 45, which were bugs in the around weaver, and 46, which
;was to do with casts being erroneously removed by optimisations causing
;programs which should have thrown an exception to run normally.

%1.0.1 1104961494
$Fixed bug 34, in which arithmetic calculations within strings were sometimes
;misinterpreted as string concatenation. Thanks to Jonathan Churchill for
;reporting this bug.
$Fixed bug 35, Java identifiers containing '$' are not "visible" from
;pointcuts. Thanks to Kevin Viggers for an extremely clear description of the
;precise problem and the code for the fix.
$Fixed bug 36, in which circular references to named pointcuts within
;cflow caused a stack overflow.
$Fixed bug 37, named pointcuts and multiply nested cflows interact badly.
$Added support for inlining of advice bodies at join point shadows. A 
;heuristic is used to decide when to do this. Inlining also exposes 
;opportunities for removing the boxing that is sometimes associated with
;advice implementation. The original advice bodies are also removed
;if rendered redundant by inlining.
$Updated runtime library to return a value copy of the argument list from
;thisJoinPoint.getArgs(), in line with ajc bug 67592.

!If you extend ShadowMatch, AdviceApplication, Residue, 
;WeavingVar or ContextValue, you will need to implement a new method called 
;inline. The purpose of this method is to handle a new implementation of 
;constructor inlining. It should normally be straightforward to implement 
;this method; if your class contains any references to Jimple values you 
;will need to look up new versions of these references using a mapping that 
;is provided, and construct a new copy of the object. The implementations 
;in the standard abc classes should be easy to adapt.
!If you extend Residue, you will also need to implement a new optimize()
;method. If your residue does not itself contain residues, you can just
;return the same object.
!If you extend Pointcut, the inline method has acquired a new parameter
;which you can normally just ignore, or pass unchanged to any contained
;pointcuts. The sensible thing to do would be to replace this set of
;parameters with an object, and this may happen in future.
!The current implementation of advice precedence is broken and needs a 
;redesign, which will happen soon. This will likely have an impact on
;the doAddAdviceApplication method in subclasses of ShadowMatch.
!Some abc variables that can only hold Jimple immediates (locals or constants)
;but previously had the overly generic declared type Value now have the
;tighter type Immediate.
